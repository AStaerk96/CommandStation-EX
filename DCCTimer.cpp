/* This timer class is used to manage the single timer required to handle the DCC waveform.
 *  All timer access comes through this class so that it can be compiled for 
 *  various hardware CPU types. 
 *  
 *  DCCEX works on a single timer interrupt at a regular 58uS interval.
 *  The DCCWaveform class generates the signals to the motor shield  
 *  based on this timer.
